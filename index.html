            Game of Thrones is an HBO series that tells the story of a medieval country's civil war. When the story begins, a decade-long summer is ending, and winter looms as characters battle to claim the "Iron Throne," the seat of the king of the Seven Kingdoms, the regime that rules all but the northern tip of Westeros. Every character has different story and they faced different challenges. This game basically tells the and shows the lives of different characters in game of thrones and their challenges that they faced.The show is divided into three major plot lines. The first covers the battle between the lords of the continent of Westeros — most notably members of the Baratheon, Lannister, and Stark families — who are involved in the fight for the Iron Throne. The second follows the rise of Daenerys Targaryen, the last member of an exiled family as she builds an army in Essos to reclaim the throne. The third plot takes place in the North of Westeros among the Night's Watch, an armed unit that guards the 300-mile-long, 70-foot-tall wall that protects the rest of the continent from the mythical creatures that lurk there.

            It's a not easy to describe GOT, other than to say it's awesome.
			It's a fantasy world which has action, adventure, thriller, suspense, politics.
			It has everything, from sex/nudity to heads being crushed/burned/decapitated, from witty acerbic humor, about love and about revenge, and any thing else u can think about.
			GOT is about what happens when 7 kingdoms/players play the GAME OF THRONES, and always remember when you play the Game of Thrones, you either win or you die.
          </p>

            Need to work on: Setting and aligning goals
            When it comes to running your own projects, you are a king with a plan and a process and understand the value of working as a pack. Your consistency and reliability has helped you build strong brand integrity. People know they can count on you and are willing to support you when you call your banners.
            But when projects get more complex, you quickly lose your footing. Whether you’re working internally within your team or cross-functionally, it seems like you never quite have the full picture to make the most informed decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we want our projects to be victorious, we’ll need to get our project plans and processes into one centralized tool. Although we may have solid projects, plans, and processes, you need to align our goals with our larger team in order for our house to succeed. Bring our teams together and set common goals and OKRs. Wrangle project management into one platform tool so that all stakeholders are aligned as they tackle their projects. So our main goal is to entertain who love to see nd enjoy Game of thrones Game and series.
